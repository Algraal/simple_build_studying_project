1. Interface methods should be reimplemented. Instead of parsing system 
arguments inside staticmethods of project classes, these arguments should be
handled by corresponding interface methods.

2. New option should be added. Creating CMakeLists.txt in temporary location
to get compile_commands.json for the correct work of the clangd.

3. Exception handling should be reviewed inside methods of all classes.

4. Old tests I written for the program when it was a set of different scripts
do not work anymore. I should write new test both for methods and for different
program use cases.

5. create_build_directory in project.py can be rewritten using create_directory
from utility.py.

6. Interface module can become a base class for to different interface classes:
InterfaceCLI and InterfaceNVIM. Common stdout, stderr outputs break nvim text
layout. Some UI of nvim should be used instead.

7. MB I should redirect stderr and stdout of SimpleBuild in a temporary log
file located in the same directory. Otherwise output of SimpleBuild and 
executable are mixed together.

8. New option for including autotests (at least simple .sh tests) should be
added. It requires some common interface for the tests to be included.
